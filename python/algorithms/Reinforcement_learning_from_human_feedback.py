# Reinforcement learning from human feedback is a type of machine learning in which an agent learns to perform
# a task by receiving feedback from a human teacher, rather than by receiving feedback from the environment 
# itself. 
# 
# The human teacher provides feedback on the agent's actions, either positively or negatively, 
# and the agent uses this feedback to adjust its behavior in order to maximize its rewards.


# This script uses a Q-table to store the expected rewards for each action in each state. 
# The user provides feedback on each action, which is used to update the Q-values using the Q-learning algorithm. 
# The next action is chosen based on the current Q-values, and the process is repeated until the user terminates the program.

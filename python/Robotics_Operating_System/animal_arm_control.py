# First, you would need to create a ROS package for your project. You can do this by following the steps in the ROS documentation.
#
# Once you have set up your package, you can use the above Python script to control the arm.
#
# This code initializes a ROS node called "animal_arm_control" and creates a publisher to send commands to 
# the animal arm and a subscriber to receive feedback from the arm. 
# 
# In the main loop, it sends a command to move the arm forward and listens for feedback from the arm. 
# The callback function is called whenever a message is received from the arm and logs the message to the console.
#
# Of course, this is just a basic example and you would need to modify it to fit the specific requirements of your animal arm. 
# You would also need to define the message types and topics for your arm.

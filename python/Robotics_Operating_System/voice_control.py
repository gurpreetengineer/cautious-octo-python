# EXPLANATION
# This code sets up a ROS node called voice_control and listens for voice commands using the speech_recognition library. When a voice command is recognized, the command is published to the voice_commands topic using the rospy.Publisher object. A callback function is also defined to handle messages received on the robot_state topic.

# Steps to create voice control code:
# First, you'll need to install ROS and the necessary Python packages. You can follow the installation instructions on the ROS website.

# Next, you'll need to create a ROS package for your voice control code. You can create a package using the catkin_create_pkg command in the terminal.

# Once you've created your package, you can create a Python script that listens for voice commands using a speech recognition library such as Google Speech Recognition or PocketSphinx.

# When a voice command is recognized, you can use ROS to send a message to the appropriate ROS node or topic to control your robot or other ROS-enabled device.

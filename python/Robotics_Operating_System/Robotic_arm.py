# This code includes code for controlling a robotic arm, its embedded camera, drivers, and joystick through ROS involves several steps, including configuring ROS, launching nodes, and creating code for the different components.

# This code initializes a ROS node named "robotic_arm_controller" and subscribes to two topics: "/camera/image" and "/joystick/cmd_vel". The "/camera/image" topic receives images from the embedded camera, while the "/joystick/cmd_vel" topic receives joystick commands to control the robotic arm and driver positions.

# The code also initializes two publishers: "/driver/position" and "/arm/position". These topics publish the positions of the driver and arm, respectively.

# In the "joystick_callback" function, the code updates the arm and driver positions based on the joystick commands received. The updated positions are then published to their respective topics.

# In the "camera_callback" function, the code uses the sensor_msgs/Image message type to receive images from the camera. The cv_bridge package is used to convert the ROS message to a numpy array that can be processed using OpenCV.The processed image is displayed using OpenCV's `imshow` function. The `waitKey` function is used to ensure that the window is updated and events are processed.

# Finally, the code creates an instance of the "RoboticArmController" class and calls the "spin" function to keep the node running.

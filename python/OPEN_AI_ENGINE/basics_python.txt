1) Create an environment (it's similar to node_modules)
    > python3 -m venv 123venv 
        (venv - command) 
        (123venv - environment name)

2) Now, go inside that environment
    > source .venv/bin/activate
        (.venv - name of the created environment)

3) Now, in that env, (in this case .venv), install relevant packages.
    > pip install package_name

4) Now you can use the packages and run the file.

C++ has a wide range of built-in algorithms that can be used for different purposes. Some of the most commonly used algorithms in C++ are:

1)  Sorting algorithms
      Bubble Sort
      Selection Sort
      Insertion Sort
      Merge Sort
      Quick Sort

2)  Searching algorithms
      Linear Search
      Binary Search

3)  String algorithms
      String sorting (using any of the sorting algorithms)
      String searching (using any of the searching algorithms)
      String matching (e.g. Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm)

4)  Graph algorithms
      Breadth-First Search (BFS)
      Depth-First Search (DFS)
      Dijkstra's Algorithm (shortest path)
      Bellman-Ford Algorithm (shortest path with negative weights)
      Kruskal's Algorithm (minimum spanning tree)
      Prim's Algorithm (minimum spanning tree)

5)  Numerical algorithms
      Euclidean Algorithm (greatest common divisor)
      Fibonacci Algorithm
      Newton's Method (finding roots of a function)
      Monte Carlo Simulation

6)  Dynamic Programming
      Longest Common Subsequence
      Knapsack Problem
      Edit Distance
7)  Miscellaneous algorithms
      Maximum subarray sum
      Convex Hull
      Binary Exponentiation

# A basic Python script for a large telescope to find unknown celestial objects could involve the following steps:

# Connect to the telescope: Use the appropriate library or module to connect to the telescope and establish communication.
# Define observation parameters: Set the observation parameters such as the field of view, exposure time, and sensitivity.
# Capture images: Capture images of the sky using the telescope's camera or imaging system.
# Process images: Use image processing techniques to clean up the images and identify any potential celestial objects.
# Analyze data: Analyze the data collected from the images and look for any patterns or anomalies that could indicate the presence of an unknown celestial object.
# Report findings: Generate a report of any potential discoveries and share the findings with the appropriate scientific community.

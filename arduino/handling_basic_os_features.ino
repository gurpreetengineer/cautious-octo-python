/**
 * In this example code, we define structures for process control blocks and memory management units, which are used to manage processes and memory, respectively. We also define functions to handle interrupts, manage processes, and manage memory. These functions would be responsible for implementing the core functionality of the operating system.

 * The main function initializes the hardware components, processes, and memory management unit, and then enters a main loop that handles interrupts, manages processes, and manages memory. The specifics of how these tasks are performed will depend on the particular operating system being developed.

 * Again, it's important to note that kernel development is a complex and challenging task that requires a deep understanding of computer science, operating systems, and hardware systems. If you're interested in learning more about kernel development, there are many online resources and books available that cover the topic in detail.

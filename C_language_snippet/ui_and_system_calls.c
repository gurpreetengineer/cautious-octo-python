/**
 * Implementing system calls is a critical part of kernel development. System calls are the interface that user applications use to interact with the operating system, allowing them to access various operating system features such as file I/O, process management, and memory management. Here is an example code that demonstrates how system calls can be implemented in a simple operating system:
*/

// Define the system call interface
int read(int fd, void *buf, int len);
int write(int fd, void *buf, int len);
int open(char *filename, int flags);
int close(int fd);
int fork();
int exit(int status);

// Define the system call handler function
int handle_syscall(int syscall_number, int arg1, void *arg2, int arg3)
{
    int retval;

    // handle the system call based on the syscall_number
    switch (syscall_number)
    {
    case READ_SYSCALL:
        retval = read(arg1, arg2, arg3);
        break;
    case WRITE_SYSCALL:
        retval = write(arg1, arg2, arg3);
        break;
    case OPEN_SYSCALL:
        retval = open((char *)arg1, arg2);
        break;
    case CLOSE_SYSCALL:
        retval = close(arg1);
        break;
    case FORK_SYSCALL:
        retval = fork();
        break;
    case EXIT_SYSCALL:
        exit(arg1);
        break;
    default:
        // handle unknown system call
        retval = -1;
        break;
    }

    return retval;
}

// Define the read system call
int read(int fd, void *buf, int len)
{
    // perform the read operation
    return 0;
}

// Define the write system call
int write(int fd, void *buf, int len)
{
    // perform the write operation
    return 0;
}

// Define the open system call
int open(char *filename, int flags)
{
    // perform the open operation
    return 0;
}

// Define the close system call
int close(int fd)
{
    // perform the close operation
    return 0;
}

// Define the fork system call
int fork()
{
    // perform the fork operation
    return 0;
}

// Define the exit system call
int exit(int status)
{
    // perform the exit operation
    return 0;
}

/**
 * In this example code, we define the system call interface, which includes functions for reading, writing, opening, closing, forking, and exiting. We also define a system call handler function that handles system calls based on the syscall_number. The read, write, open, close, fork, and exit system calls are implemented with placeholder code that performs the appropriate operation.

The specifics of how system calls are implemented will depend on the particular operating system being developed. However, this example code gives you an idea of how system calls can be implemented in a simple operating system.

Again, it's important to note that kernel development is a complex and challenging task that requires a deep understanding of computer science, operating systems, and hardware systems. If you're interested in learning more about kernel development, there are many online resources and books available that cover the topic in detail.

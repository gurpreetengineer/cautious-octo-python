// an example of how you can initialize the hardware components of a system in a kernel written in C:

#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

// Define memory-mapped I/O addresses for hardware registers
#define GPIO_BASE       0x20200000
#define GPIO_FSEL0      (GPIO_BASE + 0x00)
#define GPIO_SET0       (GPIO_BASE + 0x1C)

#define UART0_IBRD      (UART0_BASE + 0x24)
#define UART0_FBRD      (UART0_BASE + 0x28)
#define UART0_LCRH      (UART0_BASE + 0x2C)
#define UART0_CR        (UART0_BASE + 0x30)

// Define helper functions for reading and writing to hardware registers
static inline void mmio_write(uint32_t reg, uint32_t data) {
    *(volatile uint32_t*)reg = data;
}

static inline uint32_t mmio_read(uint32_t reg) {
    return *(volatile uint32_t*)reg;
}

// Initialize the hardware components of the system

    // Enable GPIO pin 16 as an output
    uint32_t fsel = mmio_read(GPIO_FSEL0);
    fsel &= ~(0x07 << 18);
    fsel |= (0x01 << 18);
    mmio_write(GPIO_FSEL0, fsel);

    // Configure the UART for 115200 baud, 8N1
    mmio_write(UART0_CR, 0x00);     // Disable UART
    mmio_write(UART0_IBRD, 1);      // Set baud rate to 115200
    mmio_write(UART0_FBRD, 40);
    mmio_write(UART0_LCRH, (3<<5)); // 8-bit data, no parity, 1 stop bit
    mmio_write(UART0_CR, 0x301);    // Enable UART (Tx, Rx, FIFO)
}

// Entry point for the kernel
void kernel_main(void) {

    // Blink LED and output message over UART
    while (true) {

        mmio_write(UART0_DR, 'H');         // Output 'H' over UART
        while (mmio_read(UART0_FR) & 0x10);// Wait until UART transmit FIFO is empty
        mmio_write(GPIO_CLR0, 0x01 << 16); // Set GPIO16 low
        mmio_write(UART0_DR, 'i');         // Output 'i' over UART

/**

*In this example, the init_hardware function initializes the GPIO pin 16 as an output and configures the UART for 115200 baud, 8N1. The kernel_main function then uses these hardware components to blink an LED connected to GPIO16 and output the message "Hi" over the UART.

* Note that the exact code required to initialize the hardware components will depend on the specific hardware platform you are targeting. Additionally, the exact steps required to initialize the CPU will depend on the architecture of the CPU, and may involve setting up the interrupt controller, enabling the memory management unit (MMU), and other low-level tasks.

* It's also worth noting that in practice, kernel development is a complex and challenging task that requires a deep understanding of the underlying hardware and software systems. This example code is intended only as a starting point to give you an idea of what kernel initialization might look like in practice.

* If you are interested in learning more about kernel development, I would recommend starting with a simple operating system such as xv6, which is a small Unix-like operating system developed by MIT. There are also many online resources and books available that cover the topic in detail.



* Once the hardware components are initialized, the next step in kernel development is typically to set up the system's software infrastructure. This may involve tasks such as:

1) Creating an initial process or thread to run the first user program or shell.
2) Initializing the system call interface that allows user programs to interact with the kernel.
3) Setting up a virtual file system that provides a standardized interface for accessing files and other resources.
4) Configuring the network stack, if the operating system provides networking capabilities.


* Again, the specifics of what needs to be done will depend on the particular operating system being developed and the hardware it is running on. However, these tasks give you an idea of the kinds of things that must be done during the kernel initialization process.

* It's important to note that kernel development is a complex and challenging task that requires a deep understanding of computer science, operating systems, and hardware systems. If you're interested in learning more about kernel development, there are many online resources and books available that cover the topic in detail.

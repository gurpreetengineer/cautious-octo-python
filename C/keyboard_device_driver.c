/**
 * Communicating with various hardware devices is another critical part of operating system development. The code required to communicate with hardware devices depends on the specific hardware being used and the operating system being developed. However, the following example code demonstrates how a simple operating system can communicate with a basic hardware device, such as a keyboard:
*/

// Define keyboard input/output ports
#define KEYBOARD_DATA_PORT 0x60
#define KEYBOARD_STATUS_PORT 0x64

// Initialize keyboard
void init_keyboard()
{
    // disable interrupts
    asm("cli");

    // send the keyboard enable command to the status port
    outb(KEYBOARD_STATUS_PORT, 0xAE);

    // read the status port to ensure that the command was received
    while (inb(KEYBOARD_STATUS_PORT) & 0x02)
        ;

    // send the keyboard set scan code command to the data port
    outb(KEYBOARD_DATA_PORT, 0xF0);
    while (inb(KEYBOARD_STATUS_PORT) & 0x02)
        ;
    outb(KEYBOARD_DATA_PORT, 0x01);
    while (inb(KEYBOARD_STATUS_PORT) & 0x02)
        ;

    // enable interrupts
    asm("sti");
}

// Read keyboard input
char get_input()
{
    char c = 0;

    // wait for a key to be pressed
    while ((inb(KEYBOARD_STATUS_PORT) & 0x01) == 0)
        ;

    // read the key from the data port
    c = inb(KEYBOARD_DATA_PORT);

    return c;
}

/**
 * In this example code, we define keyboard input/output ports and initialize the keyboard by sending commands to the status and data ports. We then define a get_input function that waits for a key to be pressed and then reads the key from the data port.

Again, the specifics of communicating with hardware devices will depend on the particular operating system being developed and the hardware being used. However, this example code demonstrates how a simple operating system can communicate with a basic hardware device.

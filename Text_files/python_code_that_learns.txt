To write a Python code that learns from another Python code, you can use machine learning techniques such as natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the code and extract relevant information from it. One possible approach could be:

1) Use a code parser library such as "ast" to parse the source code and generate an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representation of the code.
2) Traverse the AST and extract relevant information such as variable names, function names, and their usages.
3) Use NLP techniques such as Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging to extract meaningful phrases and context from the extracted information.
4) Use the extracted information to train a machine learning model such as a neural network or decision tree to learn from the source code.
5) Use the trained model to generate new code or provide suggestions for improving existing code.

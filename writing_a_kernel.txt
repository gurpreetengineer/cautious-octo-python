Writing a kernel is a highly complex and specialized task that requires extensive knowledge of computer architecture, operating system design, and low-level programming languages such as C and assembly. It is not something that can be accomplished with a simple code example or tutorial.

That being said, here is a general overview of the steps involved in writing a small kernel operating system:

1) Choose a platform: Decide on the hardware platform you want to develop your kernel for, such as x86, ARM, or MIPS.

2) Develop the boot loader: Write the code that will be responsible for loading the kernel into memory and starting the operating system.
[ >>> bootloader_logic.asm] (folder: assembly_language_code)


3) Initialize the system: Develop the code that will initialize the hardware components of the system, such as the CPU, memory, and peripherals.

4) Implement basic operating system features: Develop the code that will handle basic operating system features such as process management, memory management, and interrupt handling.
[ >>> handling_basic_os_features.ino] (folder: arduino_snippet)


5) Implement system calls: Develop the code that will provide an interface for user applications to interact with the operating system.

6) Develop device drivers: Develop the code that will enable the operating system to communicate with various hardware devices, such as storage devices, network cards, and displays.

7) Write user-space applications: Develop the code for user applications that can run on the operating system.

This is just a very high-level overview of the steps involved in writing a small kernel operating system. It's important to note that this is a highly complex and difficult task that requires a significant amount of expertise and specialized knowledge. If you're interested in learning more, I recommend researching the topic further and seeking out resources and guidance from experienced kernel developers.
